The Account Reconciliation Risk Rating visualization is a tool that identifies those reconciliations that need to be reviewed more closely.

The risk rating used in this case was redefined and throws different results than the previous rating. 

The first dashboard shows the risk rating by GL account. On the other hand, the second dashboard shows the risk rating by reconciliation. As several GL accounts constitute one reconciliation, the reconciliation dashboard is more targeted to finance managers.

Lastly, the dashboard also includes the comparison between the risk rating figures with the current one and the previous. This tells us that by changing the risk rating definition criteria, the number of GL accounts and reconciliations that required more attention, decreased.
