The PL Analytics visualization tool showcases the P&L of a company current performance as well as comparisons with previous periods.

The first tab shows a general overview of the P&L composition, and as we toggle along the subsequent dashboards, we gain a more detailed view.

The second dashboard shows the breakdown of the P&L by sub-accounts and the last one, offers a deeper view on the revenue composition. 

The data was extracted from SQL and connected to Tableau directly.
